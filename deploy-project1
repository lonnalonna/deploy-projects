 once in a while we need to do a complete inventory of server and this is a manual effort.
    write a script to help automate this:
     These are some of the things that we usually check on a machine:
      - os version
      - kernel version
      - number of cpus
      - total memory
      - if the system is 64 bit or 32
      - os type


      sol:
  touch system_inv.sh
  chmod +x system_inv.sh
  vi system_inv.sh
  
  #!/bin/bash
  
  ## system inventory
  
  echo " checking the kernel version... "
  sleep 2
  uname -r 
  echo " checking the memory... "
  sleep 2
  free -m
  echo " checking the hard drive ... "
  sleep 2
  lsblk
  echo " checking the os type and version ... "
  sleep 2
  cat /etc/*release
  echo " checking the number of processor ... "
  sleep 2
  nproc
  echo "inventory done successfully have a nice day!"
  sleep 2
